 Here are tables in my database and the  columns in the corresponding database. I give you human commands and you return sql query to do that on the dataset. I want only the sql query and nothing else.

Here is the information about tables
[
    {
        name: "lens-public-data.polygon.public_profile_post",
        columns: {
            post_id : "Unique ID of the post. Sometime also informally referred to as publication id.", 
            profile_id: "Profile ID or the user who created the post. Sometimes also called user id", 
            block_timestamp: "Time when teh post was inserted or created.", 
            language: "Language used in the post", 
            content_warning: "Tells if there is any warning about the post",

SELECT address, follow_profile_id FROM lens-public-data.polygon.public_follower
SELECT profile_id total_posts total_comments total_mirrors total_publications total_collects FROM lens-public-data.polygon.public_profile_stats
